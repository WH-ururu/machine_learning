    "* This is like the **Hello World** algorithm of the machine learning universe.  \n",
    "* It may be one of the easiest of the lot to understand and use but it is by no means any less powerful.  \n",
    "* Published in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt, the **perceptron algorithm** gained much attention because of its guarantee to **find a separator in a separable data set.**  \n",
    "* A perceptron is a function (or a simplified neuron to be precise) which takes a vector of real numbers as input and generates a real number as output.  \n",
    "* Mathematically, a perceptron can be represented as:  \n",
    "$$ y=f(w_{1}x_{1} + w_{2}x_{2}+ \\cdots + w_{n}x_{n}+b)=f(w^{T}x+b)$$  \n",
    "Where, $w_{1}, \\cdots, w_{n}$ are weights, $b$ is a constant termed as bias, $x_{1},\\cdots, x_{n}$ are inputs, and $y$ is the output of the function f, which is called the **activation function**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is as follows:  \n",
    "    1. Initialize weight vector $w$ and bias $b$ to **small random numbers**.  \n",
    "    2. Calculate the output vector $y$ based on the function $f$ and vector $x$.  \n",
    "    3. Update the weight vector $w$ and bias $b$ to counter the error.  \n",
    "    4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until there is no error or the error drops below a certain threshold.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "The algorithm tries to find a **separator** which divides the input into two classes by using a **labeled data set** called **the training data set** (the training data set corresponds to the experience E as stated in the definition for machine learning in the previous section). The algorithm starts by assigning **random weights** to the weight vector $w$ and the bias $b$. It then processes the input based on the function $f$ and gives a vector $y$. This generated output is then compared with the correct output value from the training data set and the updates are made to $w$ and $b$ respectively. To understand the weight update process, let us consider a point, say $p1$, with a correct output value of +1. Now, suppose if the perceptron misclassifies $p1$ as -1, it updates the weight $w$ and bias $b$ to move the perceptron by a small amount (movement is restricted by learning rate to prevent sudden jumps) in the direction of $p1$ in order to correctly classify it. The algorithm stops when it finds the correct separator or when the error in classifying the inputs drops below a certain user defined threshold."
